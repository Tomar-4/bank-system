# 🏦 Menu-Driven Bank Management System in Python

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates a simple banking system using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and more — all through a command-line menu.
